If you have any topics you would like to cover, please let me know, and I will do my best to accommodate."

The code can be written in over 40 languages including Python, R, and Scala. Most importantly, the code can be interacted with when the notebook is opened in a local (that is, on your computer) iPython server. Alternatively, it can simply be viewed through a github repository (like [this very notebook](https://github.com/snifflesnrumjum/python4geosciences/blob/master/materials/0_intro.ipynb)) or through [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).\n",

    "* `ls`: list files in current directory. `ls -l` list files in long format to include more information, `ls -a` to list all files even those that are usually not shown because the have a `.` in front, `ls -h` to show file sizes in human readable format. Flags can always be combined to use multiple options at once, as in `ls -ah` to show all files in human readable format.\n",
    "* [tab]: Tab completion. You can always push tab in the terminal window to see available options. As you have some letters entered and push tab, the options will be limited to those that fit the pattern you have started.\n",
    "* `mkdir [dirname]`: make directory called dirname.\n",
