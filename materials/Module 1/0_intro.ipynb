You'll need to sign in with your NetID, and click on the little blue link that says \"AnyConnect VPN\" if and when you find that \"Web-based installation was unsuccessful\" to install Cisco AnyConnect (you will no longer use the web-based installer after this). When you open the Cisco application on your computer, you will need to fill in \"connect.tamu.edu\" in the little box, then use your NetID and university password to connect.

Most importantly, the code can be interacted with when the notebook is opened in a local (that is, on your computer) iPython server. Alternatively, it can simply be viewed through a github repository (like [this very notebook](https://github.com/snifflesnrumjum/python4geosciences/blob/master/materials/0_intro.ipynb)) or through [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).\n",

Flags can always be combined to use multiple options at once, as in `ls -ah` to show all files in human readable format.\n",
    "* [tab]: Tab completion. You can always push tab in the terminal window to see available options. As you have some letters entered and push tab, the options will be limited to those that fit the pattern you have started.\n",

    "Class materials are available on a [GitHub](http://github.org) repository. GitHub is a way to share and access code online which has been version-controlled using git. Version control allows changes in code to be tracked over time; this is important for reproducibility, retrieving code in case of accidents, and working on code in groups. Git is one way to version control your code — other methods include subversion (svn), cvs, and mercurial. More information on this is provided below.\n",
